# 2048

Welcome to one of my first (out of several more that will come in the future) projects, where I am just trying to practice my skills with Typescript + React. As this is basically a project I'm doing for learning and having fun there is not much to describe to it. However, I would appreciate very much any feedback and suggestions on how to improve my coding.

Thank you!

## What I want to include in this project

1. A basic "board" that represents the 2048 game (React)

2. A score component that renders the current score, and the highest achieved score (react)

3. A button to restart the game whenever it is over (react)

4. Code that runs the logic of the game (typescript)

5. Unit tests for such code

6. User authentification, so that there can also be a global highest score, and you can resume your last played game (firebase)
